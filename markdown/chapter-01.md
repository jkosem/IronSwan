# Introduction

Welcome to this web book. This chapter demonstrates the basic markdown features supported by our reader.

## Headers

The reader supports three levels of headers, as shown in this chapter.

### Images

Images are supported and will scale responsively:

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. This makes the content easy to read in both markdown and rendered form.

The text will automatically flow to fit the container width while maintaining readability through appropriate line length and spacing.

### Typography

The reader uses a clean, modern typeface that works well for extended reading sessions. The dark theme reduces eye strain, especially during nighttime reading.
